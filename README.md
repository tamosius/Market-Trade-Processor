### Spring MVC REST Workflow
The following steps describe a typical Spring MVC REST workflow:
The client sends a request to a Web Service in URI form.
The request is intercepted by the DispatcherServlet which looks for Handler Mappings and its type.
- The Handler Mappings section defined in the application context file tells DispatcherServlet which strategy to use to find controllers based on the incoming request.
- Spring MVC supports three different types of mapping request URIs to controllers: annotation, name conventions and explicit mappings. I will be using the annotation approach.
- Requests are processed by the Controller and the response is returned to the DispatcherServlet which then dispatches to the view.
- WebSockets could be implemented to notify each client that the datasource has been changed, each client will then make a new call to the RESTful webservice to retrieve the latest model. (WebSockets are not implemented).

### Message Consumption
The initial message will be consumed via Web Service at URL: **http://{host}:{port}/Market_Trade_Processor/rest/getTradeInfo**. Trade message will be POSTâ€™d to this endpoint and will take the JSON form of:

**{"userId": "134256", "currencyFrom": "EUR", "currencyTo": "GBP", "amountSell": 1000, "amountBuy": 747.10, "rate": 0.7471, "timePlaced" : "14-JAN-15 10:27:44", "originatingCountry" : "FR"}.**

To load this JSON object in a front end view, type: **http://{host}:{port}/Market_Trade_Processor/**.

### Message Processor
Process messages received via the message consumption endpoint.
The interface is **com.tomas.dao.ProcessDate.java**.

Implementaion are under the package **com.tomas.dao.imlementation**.
- ProcessDataImplementation.java -> processes the messages and stores it in the ArrayList.

### Message Frontend
Developed with JSP, Jquery and fetched data via Ajax calls. New messages can be processed by submitting the form and new trade will be displayed in the table.

### Security
In order to use Spring Security I must add the necessary dependencies in the **pom.xml** file: 
  
  **<dependency>**
    **<groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>**
    **<artifactId>spring-security-web</artifactId>**
    **<version>3.2.10.CI-SNAPSHOT</version>**
  **</dependency>**
  **<dependency>**
    **<groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>**
    **<artifactId>spring-security-config</artifactId>**
    **<version>3.2.10.CI-SNAPSHOT</version>**
  **</dependency>**
